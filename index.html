          <h1>Admiral General GP</h1>
          <p id="about"><p>The need of the hour is that all Hindus should be united for safegaurding our ancient religion beyond the clutches of casteism which has been one of the reasons why people have converted to other faith in the past. 
We need to show love and respect first for our Hindu brothers and sisters, help those who are in need, be united in stance against violence against Hindus, safegaurd our temples and promote our values and way of life 
While voting may be irrelevant for many,we should not forget that there are many parties that stand up for the so called minority appeasement.We need to show our solidarity & vote for the one party that stands up for Hinduism.
This is not a call for intolerance and hate against Muslims or other communities. Let them be at peace.But, if they can protect and promote their leaders, we too need to support and vote for our Hindu leaders as well. </p> <p>
One of the things that you see on the internet is the unbroken, unbent & unbowed support people of other faith have for their leaders, however hypocritical and bigot it is. But when we support ours, its #Hindutwa. 
We have to keep this flame burning and unite our religion.Hinduism has never preached about hate against any non-believer,it has advocated only one stance-The stance against Adharma or Injustice.
While people lament on the deaths of their communities during a collateral community clash,if you look into the records as per Wiki, edited by members of all communities,more Hindus have died than Muslims .</p><p>
Lets take a moment to study why there is communal hate,why there is "Islamophobia",read about religions and then look at our own religion. have gone through many resources and see that our religion is great, if not the greatest but it has its flaws!Its high time we Hindus Unite!
The challenge we face is how to stop Hindus from getting converted.The only reason I see from say a 1% chance of conversion due to God's miracle can be nothing else but getting benefits due to conversion-job,education for kids and so on.This is a real issue.
And moderate Hindus you might have observed who have changed their religion to say Christianity will flock the churches every single Sunday."Did the church really enlighten make them see God in one stroke of Baptism?" has always been my question. </p><p>
Some of us Hindus make fun of Nithyananda for his sex scandals,call Asaram Bapu with names & mock on Patanjali products but have you seen a follower of Islam ever complain about the passages from Q which is unfit(for a non-believer).Have you seen Christians condemning healers?
That will never happen.Atleast folks like Nityananda are doing things for the religion.Controversies aside, atleast do 20% of good to the people.Puttaparthi was a barren land.SaiBaba changed their present.Unless we do something for Hindus, we dont have the right to comment.</p><p>
If you look back at how Islam is practised and preached,it comes right from childhood where kids are told that prayers is important.You  will not find a relaxation however learned they are.They understand importance of religion.But ours is a way of life, as we say!
The above reason certainly attributes towards #conversion.Our #detachment from #understanding #vedas,our gods and our approach to #religion. It is very casual.Kids should be taught to recite prayers, understand the importance of religion in life but that comes from you!
Revival of Hinduism should not be based upon hatred towards other communities but building our own fundamentals and things that will make all Hindus be united over social complexities.However,one should be vocal enough to point and confront people who talk ill about our religion.</p><p>
Which country will allow 99% of majority population also to be accused of mass murders by minorities even if they have no clue whatsoever as to where it’s happening?Its only India. As a Hindu & if we believe our religion is about peace,we shouldn’t tolerate this onslaught on us!!
The population growth of minorities causes a #distress in any community and Muslims and Christians(both in particular) must understand this.Imagine if it was the case with Pak or Saudi,do you think they would have reacted differently?
If #secularism is important,the minorities should also respect the wishes of the #majority but if you threaten and accuse all Hindus with murders,#fascism, we as Hindus should forget everything beyond party lines and confront it.If you don't do it, our religion is but doomed.</p><p>
It is easy to spread #rumours about a religion. You know what is happening with Islam(some of it)?But compared to Islam, it is a challenge that no individual can refer to our texts and say that it preaches violence.But why is the hate against Hinduism spreading far and beyond?
It is because we are docile and relaxed when it comes to our religion and we think Hinduism is a way of life. It is time for us to change that #philosophy. In our quest to accomodate others,we simply forget what religion we belong to or what values it teaches us.
Do you think the #hate against Islam or non-whites will stop with #condemnation?What is causing the intellectual society of the West to be part of the hate?You can call it a few but everyone has a sense of fear of being a minority in his own homeland.
That is why there is #immigration law.A free society is all good in papers but unless a country protect the interests and wishes of a majority population, the fear will not stop.The same goes with #religion. Same goes with #India.</p><p>
We being a predominantly Hindu nation so minorities should stop preaching about how bad Hindus are.That has always been the case with Hindus in India, people can talk against Hinduism because Hindus aren't united.The feeling to revive and our revival should come our hearts.</p>
          <p>I have seen many Indian Muslims sympathize with Kashmiris only based on religious similarities & Pak sponsored news.The pain that India takes to control the situation there losing soldiers everyday is not a concern for some.As Indians and a non-muslim, I really feel sad & am sure most countrymen is of this view. Kashmiris have no other go but to join the Indian mainstream.They have so many benefits yet are blinded.We Hindus want peace but not at the cost of being labelled fascists or oppressors.The "minority" also has to do its bit to come mid-way!</p>
          <h1>My complaint to most Muslims!</h1>
            <p id="about">
            <p>My voice echoes with that of Taslima Nasreen! This is exactly how I feel!</p>
<p>"Muslims must learn from the way non-Muslims from across the world have come together in solidarity to express their grief and compassion with the victims of the terrible incident in New Zealand. When non-Muslims lose lives in such senseless acts of brutal violence, Muslims too must come together in solidarity.

Those who always blame the wrongdoings of USA and Israel for Islamic terrorism, will they now blame the wrongdoings of ISIS, al-Qaeda or Boko Haram for the man barging into the mosque in New Zealand and killing all those people? If not, then obviously there must be something wrong somewhere.

The time for Muslims to remain in their state of childlike innocence has passed, the time has come for them to behave like adults and accept their responsibilities. ‘You cannot talk about my religion, you cannot argue against my sharia laws, you cannot say anything about what I wear (whether a burqa or a hijab) or what I eat (my preference of halal meat), you cannot talk about the animals I slaughter or the discrimination between the sexes that I practice in my social life, you cannot hurt my religious sentiments, make a comment against my Prophet or make a cartoon of him. You can’t comment about me praying namaz in the middle of the road and obstructing traffic, you can’t comment about my azan. If you do any of these, I will kill you, set you on fire, destroy your world…’

As it is many people nurse a lot of anger against Muslims because of numerous incidents of terror committed by Muslim terrorists across the world. And Muslim haters never miss an opportunity to insult or hit back at Muslims. The act of terror on the New Zealand mosques is the result of this hate.

The attack on the mosque itself is nothing new. Sunnis have always been known to attack Shia or Ahmadiya mosques.

The attacker in New Zealand was a racist, Right-wing Christian fundamentalist and someone who hated immigrants. A lot like the racist Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik.

Muslim haters believe that since all Muslims are terrorists, killing one is akin to getting rid of a terrorist. Their minds are so clouded with hate, their brains so impaired that they cannot reasonably understand that Muslim doesn’t equal terrorist. Millions of innocent Muslim people across the world have to pay the price for the terrorist acts committed by a few Islamic fanatics.

Thus, Muslims have to rise and condemn all acts of terrorism. If one wishes to be civilised, one must acknowledge not just one’s own rights but the rights of others as well – the human rights, democratic rights and freedom of expression granted to all people, irrespective of religion, faith, colour, gender or language."</p>
